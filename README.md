# Web Development Portfolio

This repository contains my collection of beginner web development projects. Each project demonstrates a specific concept or skill in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. These projects form the foundation of my frontend development skills, which I’m building as part of my journey to becoming an AI Engineer.

## 💡 Why This Portfolio Matters

While my main goal is to become an AI Engineer, I believe it's important to understand how users interact with intelligent systems. By learning web development, I'm building the frontend skills needed to create and deploy user-friendly AI applications in the future.

## 📁 What's Inside

- **Responsive Web Pages**  
  Projects showcasing layout, responsiveness, and basic UI/UX design using HTML and CSS.

- **JavaScript Practice Projects**  
  Exercises that include form validation, DOM manipulation, and logic-building through simple apps and interactions.

- **API Integration (Coming Soon)**  
  Plans to add projects that integrate external APIs with dynamic content updates.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript  
- Git & GitHub  
- Netlify (for hosting future live demos)

## ✅ What I’ve Learned So Far

- Building mobile-responsive websites
- Writing clean, semantic HTML and organized CSS
- Using JavaScript for interactivity and logic
- Version control using Git and GitHub

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Add live demos for each project
- Refactor and document each subproject clearly
- Integrate AI/ML mini-tools in future frontend apps
